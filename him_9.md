## Him and her - Episode 9


He was not sure if he should bother with Venice at all. It was out of the way and  seemed like a tourist trap with its cheesy gondolas and little else. But a wise old man told him "Venice is hyped a lot and yet remains under-hyped." So, he set about planning an elaborate train trip from Lausanne to Venezia Santa Lucia with a brief stop in Milan. It was summer and all the good B&Bs were booked. He managed to find a decent place which was slightly out of the way but had good reviews. In Venice, being out of the way meant just one thing - away from the main canal. This prevented one from using the Vaporetto - or water bus which ran only in the main canal and instead rely on private taxis.

His budget did not allow that. He pore over the map a dozen times and came to the conclusion that they would take a stroll from the railway station to their room. There were two things he hadn't quite accounted for - two heavy bags and half of India in the streets. All the tourist guide books had warned him about summer in Europe, but he witnessed it first hand when they got out of the station. The streets were teeming with tourists who seemed like they were trying to shop and smoke till they fell dead. There was barely space for them to squeeze through and the bags were bigger than them, To add to their misery, some bridges were built with steps, with no consideration for people trying to stroll to save money on taxis.

The B&B brought its own climax by awarding them three flights of narrow stairs, but once they conquered it, they were in a cosy room. It was a delightful setting with long windows opening up to the canal. The bathroom's marble reminded them that they were in Italy. It was already evening and they were impatient to get out. She dressed carefully and they stepped into the early night. They decided they wouldn't stray far and didn't have to, because they found a beautiful restaurant two streets away.

The tables were all set in the open air and the moon was shining down at the surrounding waters. They didn't notice what they ordered but it was all delicious. They were tired but they went for a short stroll, all the while watching their way because it was very easy to get lost in the winding lanes.

The next morning, they set out for the plaza in San Marco square and when they stepped out, it seemed like everyone in the world had the very same idea. The bustling crowd simply swept them in the right direction. She was not deterred and managed to keep her shopping spirit intact. He was mesmerized by the smell of espresso around every corner but was put off by the price. She was not so virtuous and tried out a pastry delicacy for every break. By the time they reached the square, it was time to find a place to lunch. They were careful to pick the trattorias mentioned in the guidebooks and that meant they had to traverse across the island for each meal. The lunch was completely worth the detour because they had squid ink pasta for the first time and loved it. 

They managed to try out the gelatos and canollis that Venice was popular for and before they knew it, it was time to change for dinner. After dubberm she was keen on trying out the Gondollas and he was trying to find the best bargain and a suitable time-slot. Amidst the confusion in finding the right boarding points, they missed the last trip and she was bitterly disappointed. She also had to trudge back in her heels while he lost his way a couple of times more. They were exhausted when they reached their room and she was sore at him.

The next morning, he decided to play it safe and called for a water-taxi. She had been consoled now with the promise that Venice was going to be here with all the Gondolas until they could visit her again in the near future. The train took them on for the next adventure awaiting them.
