_2nd March 2004_

Life in bangalore was bearable and even enjoyable after she moved in with the senior girls. 
There was some company on weekends and she was totally out of the homesickness she used to feel in the initial days. 
Since it was a Saturday, she decided to get a haircut in the Lakme salon she had seen near their office. 
She went there, booked a slot, and when the girl asked her for the style, told her to do it in whatever style she chose (in other words, surprise her!). 
The girl said something about two layers in the back, some framing around the face etc, and she ok-ed everything (since she was not good at selecting hairstyles and had discovered that the more she tries to be particular about an end result, the more disappointed she ends up) - The girl finished it in record time - hardly 10-15 mins and blow dried it into the most perfect , and the most non-fussy hairstyle she ever had. She was so happy that she tipped her extra and when she was walking out, she felt like a model (She knew this will last only till the next hairwash, but neverthless...) - She decided to check in on her friends in the office, which was just next door. When she walked in, as usual, he was there. She was not able to hide her excitement about the haircut and she showed it off to him. 
He seemed very amused. She knew that boys (and sometimes girls) might find these things very silly, but he didn't look bored, nor did he tease her about it. He gave the perfect reaction - acknowledging her excitement and joining in on it. Her friend had also come hoping to meet her boyfriend, but he had some other engagement. So the friend suggested that they all go to French Bread pizza and watch Ocean's Eleven afterwards. She had not watched many movies or gone out with friends much during her childhood days. Ocean's Eleven didn't seem like her kind of movie, but these days she was in on anything. So they set about - the 3 of them, him on his bike and she and her friend on her friend's bike. She didn't trust riding with a boy eventhough it was him.

At the movie theatre she was surprised that both he and her friend seemed to think that balcony was a waste and that first class tickets were enough. She had gone to very few movies with her family, but she remembers her father insisting on getting balcony tickets as if everything else was not good. So she was confused , but they also seemed to realize that now that they're working men and women it didn't hurt to watch movies in balcony seats. The movie was very entertaining and and she went back to her housemates with the satisfaction of a good day spent with friends.
My housemates were planning on a movie in the night & asked me to join - It was a Tamil movie and their friends- the boys - had bought the tickets so we didn't have to stand in the queue. Going out in the night was always exciting for me. At the theatre I suddenly saw him and his friends. He was smoking, I think. I tried to catch his eye but he had not seen me and we were far. 

I feel very confused whenever I see him smoke. He's the most intelligent and truthful person I've met, and it was beyond my comprehension to understand why he'd make a wrong choice in such an obvious and easy case. I was too young to understand about "addiction" -  also at that age you wouldn't think that when people reason about something which does not make any sense, it is usually what they like to believe themselves, not necessarily what the truth is. I remember jokingly telling him sometime before that I'd be ashamed to have a friend who smokes so please don't introduce yourself when I am with my friends. I know it shouldn't bother me but deep down somewhere, it did. My explanation was that we subconsciously think of our friends as our reflections - our extensions and our choices and we are not able to make peace with a choice you'd be so ashamed of , yourself. On the other hand, out of all my friends, of late he's the one I am most myself, with. I  thought about what his mother (or sister) would be feeling. The sense of pride you feel about a person who's so nice and talented, whether it's your son or brother must be immense - but then you see this inconsistency where he doesn't value himself enough not to smoke & it is a very confusing area. Then I reminded myself that he is just a friend and it is none of my business what his mother or sister felt. But what I felt was also as confusing - also so far I haven't had any friend (or anyone close enough in the family) who smoked or drank so I hadn't faced this conflict before.
The movie was "Kannathil Muthamittal" by Mani Ratnam. When I was watching the Tamil movie, I felt that I was sharing something that was his, with him (for he was Tamil) eventhough I was in the balcony & he was in one of the lower seats.
