_2nd March 2004_

Life in bangalore is bearable and even enjoyable after she moved in with the senior girls. There is some company on weekends, and she is totally out of the homesickness she used to feel in the initial days. Since it was a Saturday, she decided to get a haircut in the Lakme salon she had seen near their office. She went there and booked a slot, and when the girl asked her about the cut, told her to do it in whatever style she chose (in other words, surprise her!). The parlor girl said something about two layers in the back, some framing around the face etc, and she ok-ed everything (since she was not good at selecting hairstyles & have discovered that the more she tries to be particular about an end result, the more disappointed she ends up) - The girl finished it in record time - hardly 10-15 mins and blow dried it into the most perfect, and the most non-fussy hairstyle she ever had. She was so happy she tipped thr girl extra and when she was walking out, she felt like a model (She knew this will last only till the next hairwash, but neverthless...) - She decided to check in on her friends in the office and when she walked in, as usual, he was there! She was not able to hide her excitement about the haircut and she showed it off to him. He seemed very amused. She knew that boys (and sometimes girls) might find these things very silly, but he didn't look bored, nor did he tease her about it - He gave the perfect reaction - acknowledging her excitement and joining in on it. Her friend had also come to the office hoping to meet her boyfriend, but he had some other engagement. So the friend suggested that the three of them go to French Bread pizza and watch Ocean's Eleven afterwards. She had not watched many movies or gone out with friends much during her childhood days. Ocean's Eleven didn't seem like her kind of movie, but these days she was in on anything. So they set off, she in her friend's bike and he in his. She did not yet trust riding in a boy's bike, eventhough the boy was him.

At the movie theatre she is surprised that both he and her friend seemed to think that balcony is a waste and that first class tickets are enough. She has gone to very few movies with her family, but she remembers her father insisting on getting balcony tickets as if everything else was not good. So she was confused , but they also seemed to realize that now that they're working men and women it doesn't hurt to watch movies in balcony seats. The movie was very entertaining and she went back to her housemates with the satisfaction of a good day spent with friends.

Her housemates were planning on a movie in the night and asked her to join. It was a Tamil movie and their friends - the boys - had bought the tickets so they didn't have to stand in the queue. Going out in the night was always exciting for her. At the theatre she suddenly saw him and his friends. He was smoking, she thought. She tried to catch his eye but he had not seen her and they were far. 

She feels very confused whenever she sees him smoke. He's the most intelligent and truthful person she has met, and it was beyond her comprehension to understand why he would make a wrong choice in such an obvious and easy case. She was too young to understand about "addiction" -  also at that age you wouldn't think that when people reason about something which does not make any sense, it is usually what they like to believe themselves, not necessarily what the truth is. She remembers jokingly telling him sometime before that she'd be ashamed to have a friend who smokes so please don't introduce yourself when she is with her friends.  She knows that it shouldn't bother her but deep down somewhere, it did. Her explanation was that we subconsciously think of our friends as our reflections - our extensions and our choices - and we are not able to make peace with a choice you would be so ashamed of, yourself. On the other hand, out of all her friends, of late he's the one she is most herself, with. She  thought about what his mother (or sister) would be feeling. The sense of pride you feel about a person who's so nice and talented, whether it's your son or brother must be immense - but then you see this inconsistency where he doesn't value himself enough not to smoke and it is a very confusing area. Then she reminded herself that he is just a friend and that it is none of her business what his mother or sister felt. But what she felt was also as confusing - also so far she hasn't had any friend (or anyone close enough in the family) who smoked or drank so she hadn't faced this conflict before.
The movie was "Kannathil Muthamittal" by Mani Ratnam. When she was watching the Tamil movie, she felt that she was sharing something that was his, with him (for he was Tamil) eventhough she was in the balcony and he was in one of the lower seats.
