## Him and her - Episode 4

### Him



They had decided to move on a whim. Or so it seemed to all their friends. His brother-in-law simply deemed it a crazy plan. The plan, if it was indeed one, lacked straightforward reasoning and was so convoluted that it seemed inside out. They knew they would want to have a baby soon, and somehow they assumed she would need to be with her mother during pregnancy. Because he would want to be with her, they decided they would need a house of their own in Kochi. That dovetailed with her desire for an independent house, which was an impossible dream in Bangalore. When they finally bought this house intended for a temporary sojourn, they then decided that it didn't make sense to live in a rented house in Bangalore when they could be living in their own house in Kochi. Therefore, they decided to move.

They didn't realize it at the time, but there were little more than kids. They had a car, but hadn't driven it further than a few kilometres, so they hired a driver to drive them to Kochi. They had paid movers and packers to bring their stuff home but because he was afraid of union workers in Kerala, they asked the moving trucks to come in at midnight. They slept in one corner of the huge house and he woke up to every real and imagined noise at night. For the first time, they had real neighbours who wanted to socialize with them and they didn't know how. For the sake of politeness, they had to sit through gender-separated parties where the women sang songs and the men drank to oblivion. 

They didn't know how to get their plumbing problems fixed or where to find an electrician from. Back in Bangalore, they had an information-circle of friends and coworkers they could tap into. Here, their only contacts were her parents, who had only old-world solutions to offer - like seeking the family carpenter's audience in his home. Their neighbours did not share their needs of readymade dosa batter or home-delivery of milk. But slowly, they found their rhythm in the new place. The spacious house allowed them a feature that had been denied to them till now - to do different things in different rooms. They had an assigned office where they worked side by side. The TV was given its own place or prominence in the living room. Though they had a dining room, they would take turns to eat dosas in front of the TV. They hadn't really grown up yet.

For the first time in their lives, they were with each other 24 hours in a day - combining work and life in one fuzzy blur. That led to many silly tiffs and quarrels. They would fight over who should bathe first just when it was lunchtime. They would work late into the night and then start arguing about dinner. The last resort was a lone restaurant on the highway for whom the process of home delivery was still a novelty. Still, the green and wet town held its charm. He relished the mornings when they sat with their respective newspapers over a cup of tea. She enjoyed taking him to the library she visited as a child, the stores she bought clothes as a teenager - and other quaint places she had grown up with. They explored the new facets of the city together - a library had come up in the suburbs, a new waterfront was being built near her house. They agreed that this was a place that was just like the two of them - fun and understated, but bound to be frustrating at times. If they had been more mature, they would have understood that they were taking the decision of their lifetime, which was to make the place their home.
