They set out: for once, the two of them truly free
To the craggy cliffs jutting out into the English sea
With freshly minted confidence, a new He
With a dreamy, resplendent She

They would walk for miles, till the sky turned red, and then grey
Hand in hand, step with step, the two of them fully present
After living with others all these years, felt they
Getting lost from humanity seemed like a godsend

Like a never ending mystery, the path before them lay
Inspiring conversations of sweet love and romance
Of deep thoughts, secret dreams and matters, in general, gay
Until they struck upon a silly quarrel, perchance 

His shoes were shot and it bothered her to no end
And she implored him to get a new pair 
He refused to abide, with no attempt to mend
Thereby escalating the sorry affair

He stood resolute, like the grey rocky cliff
Like the crashing waves, she sobbed with sorrow
With frayed tempers, neither saw it as a tiff
As they soon would, on the morrow.

For the two silly kids who went into the world, with audacity
Life smiled benevolently and held out all her gifts
When they were mindful, they revelled in her generosity
And when they weren't, lost sight of the beauty in their rifts
