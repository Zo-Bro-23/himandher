They set out: for once, the two of them truly free<br/>
To the craggy cliffs jutting out into the English sea<br/>
With freshly minted confidence, a new He<br/>
With a dreamy, resplendent She<br/>

They would walk for miles, till the sky turned red, and then grey<br/>
Hand in hand, step with step, the two of them fully present<br/>
After living with others all these years, felt they<br/>
Getting lost from humanity seemed like a godsend<br/>

Like a never ending mystery, the path before them lay<br/>
Inspiring conversations of sweet love and romance<br/>
Of deep thoughts, secret dreams and matters, in general, gay<br/>
Until they struck upon a silly quarrel, perchance<br/>

His shoes were shot and it bothered her to no end<br/>
And she implored him to get a new pair<br/> 
He refused to abide, with no attempt to mend<br/>
Thereby escalating the sorry affair<br/>

He stood resolute, like the grey rocky cliff<br/>
Like the crashing waves, she sobbed with sorrow<br/>
With frayed tempers, neither saw it as a tiff<br/>
As they soon would, on the morrow.<br/>

For the two silly kids who went into the world, with audacity<br/>
Life smiled benevolently and held out all her gifts<br/>
When they were mindful, they revelled in her generosity<br/>
And when they weren't, lost sight of the beauty in their rifts<br/>

~ Him
