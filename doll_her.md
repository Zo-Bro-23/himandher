### Episode 3 By her

The moment she had her first job, there were two things she wanted to spend money on, for herself. Chocolates and dolls! It sounds silly, but she was still a little girl at heart and she had this fancy that she didn't have enough 'mushy' while growing up. She started getting chocolates from all fronts, from her classmates, especially boys who had jobs by then! Since he was her friend, she'd happily share them with him too. Once, when he was buying flowers and chocolates for his sister for her anniversary (or birthday?) he bought for her too, saying he felt guilty always finishing up her chocolates. She found it sweet that he'd buy flowers and chocolates for his sister, but did not feel comfortable when he bought her those. Was it crossing a line? 

The days of 2001-2002 were the best of bangalore days. They earned a lot of money for the times, and they had a very relaxed job which didn't require them to work much. Much of the time was spent like college kids, roaming around Brigade road trying to find Linda Goodman's sun signs and Harry Potter books, and on shopping trips to streetside vendors to buy bags for her and sunglasses for him. He had some favorite dosa joints like Prakash's coffee house near Brigade road where he'd take her to taste Tamil food and coffee. Sometimes they'd have company sponsored team outings at the pizza joints in the Brigade road and dessert at Corner House.

Then she saw them! As they were walking back after one of their team's visits to the Corner House - The long legged, round faced dolls and huge Tweety birds displayed by the street vendors. She'd see these stuffed dolls in Archie's and Hallmark stores, but they'd be way too overpriced. Moreover, she never had anyone who'd pamper her with dolls, ever since her grandmother passed away. Brigade road looked lovely, like Archie's or Kemp Fort. She wanted the "Chimbi" paava, but he said that the street vendor was quoting exorbitant prices. 

Next day he tells her in office that he has seen her Chimbi paava in Jayanagar - where he stayed with his sister and her husband - at half the price. She immediately wants it, but doesn't trust to ask him to buy it himself. She knows that boys don't look at details, it could be some other doll for all she knows! He says they could go check it out during lunch. She's in a dilemma - she does not want to go on his bike, but they know each other so well and are such friends by now that it feels odd to talk about everything else and still have such an attitude about a bike ride. Also, she badly wanted the doll.  

So they come out early for lunch and set out. When they reached Jayanagar, she couldn't hide her disappointment. Her chimbi paava had felt skin. These ones had a coarse cloth for skin, also the eyes and nose were not at all in place. She gave him a look! "How can you call these the same?". He was flabbergasted  - "What do I know? They looked the same to me!". Boys!! she rolled her eyes. .. 

As if to change the topic, he said his sister's house was next street, and that he'd show her the house. She felt mildly curious about the house, it was the first floor of the typical 3 story apartments which were so popular in Bangalore in those days, where the house owner would stay in one floor and rent out the others. The house owner was in front of the house and looked at them with an odd expression, and she immediately regretted blindly following him. Then she brushed it aside thinking, at least at 21, she should stop looking at herself from other people's eyes. But there was this passing thought - what if his sister finds it odd that he brought a girl into the house when nobody was there? Will she have to care about what she thinks? She looked at him. He looked like a small boy taking his best friend on a tour of his house, showing off his favorite corners and toys. They went to the cozy little house and he promised her that he'll get her the doll from Brigade road itself. 

She was still disappointed that she rode pillion on his bike for this useless trip. They hadn't had lunch, so he took her to his favorite sandwich joint near the office and got her paneer sandwiches. He was a vegetarian, so she had to be content with his favorites when she was with him.Slowly, she started having some of her favorites among them too, but that is a later story. After office, he took her to Brigade road in the evening and got her the doll. She slept hugging Chimbi paava that day. 

Next day she asked him what his sister said, if he had told her about taking her there. He replied that even before he reached, the house owner had informed her that he had come there with a girl during lunchtime. She was anxious, what did your sister say? He laughed, my sister asked if your friend liked the house. She was more curious about your opinion of the house. She asked him if his sister wouldn't find it silly that a girl should go around in search of a doll. He was like, maybe, she usually isn't the mushy type and she may find it silly, but she didn't say anything about that.

That doll, her chimbi paava, has changed many homes since then. It used to be with her in her house which she shared with her seniors. Later, once when she was going home on a long holiday, he looked like he was about to cry, so he gave the doll to him. He would keep it close to him whenever he missed her and would write emails to her about how the doll looks like her, with a round face and a wide smile....Later, after she moved into his life and his home, the doll kept accompanying them to every house they moved.

The leggy doll lives with them to this day, watching over them like a guardian angel ..her wide smile, intact!
