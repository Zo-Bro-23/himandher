### Episode 5 By her

She had said "NO" to him, and to herself so many times that when the "YES" came, it was loud and clear and out of the blue! She did not remember how many times he had tried to communicate to her, his love for her, over the past 8 months. Every time, even before he started, her answer was the same..

Initially her "NO" saddened him, but eventually they had a consensus. As long as they were able to be friends, his feelings were his business. But that didn't stop him from communicating to any girl who would try to flirt with him that he was "taken". So they were happily friends for a long time, with him committed and she believing that she was not committed.

Then it hit her suddenly. She was with her family and they were discussing prospective grooms for her. They were taking a walk by Ulsoor lake, and suddenly it was crystal clear to her. Nothing made sense, her life just did not make sense belonging to anyone else. The sudden wave of sadness that hit her was unbelievable and she had a vision of him cycling upto her right there. She somehow knew that everything would be alright then. That is when she knew! She still didn't believe it for the next couple of days, which was the weekend. Incidentally she saw a book her sister was reading - "By the river Piedra I sat down and wept.." by Paulo Coehlo. The characters seemed to speak to her. She found her answers and knew that if she didn't acknowledge this miracle that was happening to her, she would regret the rest of her life.

Next day she went and told him YES, but added that she reserved the right to change that to a NO whenever she wanted. She herself wasn't sure if it was momentary craziness. He was over the moon and asked her -  Can I hold your hand from now on? 
"No, let this comfort of friendship continue..Let us be very gentle with this newfound gift that we have. Let us treat it like the delicate flame of a lamp and not risk disturbing it by sudden movements. Let it grow strong enough that nothing can blow it out.." Her answers were many and unspoken, but he read it in her eyes and said "No, let us take our time.." with a wide, happy grin on his face.
